			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<img id="bio-image" alt="ventura gif" src="./assets/images/ace.gif">
			
			<p>That's how I feel when I successfully get something to work on Sublime.</p>
			<p>I was born in Virginia and lived there until I was 33. I never realized how different the south is until I lived somewhere else. A question I have about life is- do skunks spray other skunks, and if so, does it stink to them or are they just used to it and don't care? Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
