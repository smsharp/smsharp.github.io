			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<img id="bio-image" alt="ventura gif" src="./assets/images/ace.gif">
			
			<p>That's how I feel when I successfully get something to work on Sublime.</p>
			<p>I was born in Virginia and lived there until I was 33. I graduated in 2008 from Virginia Tech with a BS in Wildlife Science. My final year of college I injured my back, which made a future of frollicing in the woods pretty difficult, so I started teaching myself graphic design. I've been designing logos, t-shirts, flyers, and the like since. After dabbling a little in web design, I decided to expand my skillset and attend CWRU's Coding Bootcamp.</p> 
			<p>Here I am. Excited and nervous. But each day I understand coding a little bit better, and that makes me more confident....And that's a good feeling.</p>
